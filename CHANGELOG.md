# Changelog

All notable changes to service-runner are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `cmd/migrate`: standalone command that applies the golang-migrate files in
  `migrations/` and exits. There was previously no way to apply the SQL schema
  without booting the service outside `APP_ENV=development`. (KPD-4)
- `CHANGELOG.md`: this file. Partially advances KPD-52.

- `migrations/003_create_pet_shops.{up,down}.sql`: SQL schema for `pet_shops`. The
  table had a GORM model but no SQL migration, so it existed only under
  `APP_ENV=development`. (KPD-59)

### Fixed

- `pet_shops` no longer exists in development only. (KPD-59)

### Changed

- README: the run block now points at the shared dev-infra stack and documents the
  single migration path.
- `cmd/server`: the development-only GORM `AutoMigrate` branch is gone. Every model
  in this service now has a SQL migration, so the migrations own the schema in all
  environments and development still gets it automatically at startup. Seeding of
  sample pet shops stays development-only. (KPD-59)

### Notes

- Migrations applied to `kilat_runner` on the shared dev-infra stack as part of KPD-4.
